# Plan
- [ ] (Step00) Initial Study for the Collage 
- [ ] (Step01) Create Backend using Django and Flask to allow basic storehouse features (storing data about goods)
  - [ ] (Step01-01) UseCases of the System
  - [ ] (Step01-02) Reltaional Database Diagram for the System
  - [ ]
- [ ] (Step02) Create Front end using React to allow usage of the basic features.

- [ ] (Step03) Add barcode fearture
